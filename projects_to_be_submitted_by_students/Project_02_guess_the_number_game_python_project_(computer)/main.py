"""
Computer Guesses Your Number ðŸŽ¯

Description:
-------------
In this game, you (the human) think of a number between 1 and a given maximum,
and the computer will try to guess it. You give feedback after each guess:
- Enter 'H' if the guess is too high,
- Enter 'L' if it's too low,
- Enter 'C' if the guess is correct.

This game demonstrates:
âœ… Binary search logic
âœ… Using conditionals and loops
âœ… Handling user input
